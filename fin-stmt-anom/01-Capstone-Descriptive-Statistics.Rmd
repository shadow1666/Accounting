## Context: Financial Statement Anomalies Trigger Regulator Red Flags

* Public companies file Financial statements reports with Securities Exchanges Commission (SEC) periodically: quarterly 10-Q, annual 10-K

  + Company executives (CEO/CFO/CCO) have responsibility to accuracy of the filings and are legally liable for material misstatements 

  + Regulators at the SEC are using analytical techniques such as Accounting Quality Model to identify outliers and anomalies and to initiate regulator examination of the companies 


  
## Business Impact of Financial Statement Anomalies

* Anomalies in financial statement could be pre-cursor to misstatements or even fraud which can severely damage reputations and company/investor fortunes

* Corrections to financial statements, restatements **after public disclosure** are costly to the company and investors, impacting profits and market value
  
## Why should companies and CxOs care?

* CxOs accounted for 68% of individual subjects of SEC’s financial statement enforcement releases

* CFO Magazine: “it can represent a hefty premium on the cost of capital and hurt the careers of senior executives once the shady dealings of such companies come to light.”
 
* SEC intends AQM could be a powerful means of improving accounting, not just for identifying fraud but also for corporate filers with disclosing financials in compliance with GAAP

* Problem studied by academia and regulators, but **no data analytics based solutions** for companies to adopt

## Questions to answer

* What kinds of anomalies are there in the financial statements, that could potentially trigger regulatory red flags?

* How to verify if a financial statement has anomalies before submitting to regulatory authorities? 

## Opportunity: Analytics to detect Financial Statement anomalies before filing


**Hypothesis**: Anomalies in Financial Statements that trigger regulatory red flags can be identified using data analytics on financial statements 

* H1: Individual financial statement facts may vary a lot across companies, even within the same sector, but ratios of financial facts can be good risk indicators 

    + A risk score based on combinations of ratios of financial facts to identify and communicate anomaly

    + Solution to the challenge of hundreds of financial facts 

* H2: Clustering (unsupervised model) to identify similar groups and anomalies

    + Clustering ratios of financial facts can help identify anomalies


## Approach - specifics, initial proposal

* Data set preparation, wrangling - use the SEC's flattened XBRL data in CSV format
    + CSV format in long format (key-value pairs), data wrangling to convert to wide format was performed

* Descriptive statistics to identify financial facts variables and computed variables ratios

* Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations

* Model, Knowledge Discovery

    + Feature selection, Model, Prediction, Cross-validation

    + Feature selection : select ratios (direct ratios from facts, compound rations from other ratios & facts)

    + k-means clustering to identify cluster for different ratios

    + Estimate cluster size (cree plot)

    + K-means cluster on different ratios
    
* Classification on identification clusters

    + CART on individual cluster to identify cluster description

    + Use tree to extract rules on anomaly risk factors

## Approach - Actual, changes to the initial proposal

* After initial data exploration and wrangling, scaled down the scope

* Financial statement included hundreds of variables - scaled down the number of variables to more commonly used facts in balancesheet, cashflow and income statements and common financial ratios

* No supervised models - since the ‘target’ variable or outcome data is not available directly, regression or classification models would not be directly attempted on the data

## Data set preparation, wrangling

* **Data set**

* Financial statements (10-K, 10-Q) in XBRL format from SEC EDGAR

    + Source: https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl/filings-and-feeds.shtml
    
    + XBRL data format is available for all companies from 2010
    
* Download XBRL data and use Altova XML/XBRL server convert to SQlite database. Reference: https://github.com/altova/SECDB/blob/master/docs/DB-SCHEMA.md

    + Financial statements in XBRL format not consumable in R
    
    + Initial proposal was to use the SEC's flattened XBRL data as CSVs - but that required more effort to "normalize" or "standardize". So, decicded to work with the XBRL format data and use XBRL-aware tools to convert and standardize variables before exporting to CSV format


* “Normalize” XBRL tagged data to standard variables to calculate ratios

* Export the balancesheet, cashflow, income statement, ratios data to CSV files

##2 - Financial Statements - Exploratory Data Analysis

* Financial statement types : Balancesheet, Cashflow Statements, Income Statements

* Statements have hundreds GAAP defined "facts"

* Issue: extreme values for individual financial fact by itself may not be an anomaly: best and worst performing companies or accounting periods

  + "Changes" compared to the facts from prior accounting periods by the company
  
      + An understanding of general relationships between certain financial statement facts is necessary to identify relationships that appear unusual
      
    + For this project, comparisons with prior accounting periods was not undertaken, due to data collection and preparation issues

## Financial Ratios for detecting anomalies

* Approach: Analyze ratios of financial facts, across companies in a sector for anomalies

* "Standard" financial ratios used by professionals to analyze, evaluate company performance
  
  + Liquidity ratios:currentRatio, quickRatio, cashRatio, debtRatio, debtEquityRatio, 
  
  + Financial Performance ratios: interestCoverage, shortTermDebtCoverage, capitalExpenditureCoverage, dividendCoverage
  
  + Efficiency ratios: assetTurnover, fixedAssertTurnover, receivablesTurnover, inventoryTurnover
  
  + Profitability ratios: grossProfitMargin, operatingProfitMargin, pretaxProfitMargin, profitMargin
