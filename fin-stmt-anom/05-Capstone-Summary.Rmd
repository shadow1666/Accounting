* Indicators of financial statement anomalies or risk factors evaluated in this analysis:

  + GAAP accounting anomalies 
  
  + Conformance to Benford distribution (of first digits)
  
  + Clustering to group financial ratios that are outside the "norms" of similar companies

  + According to WSJ: Companies, on average, **lose more than a quarter of their market value** following a financial restatement or fraud
  
## Further data analysis 

  + Validate the cluster grouping with classification tree on the clustered groups with target variable data on financial statement "red flags" data
  
  
## Next steps

* A "dashboard" of Financial Statement Anomaly risk factors as a product/service offering targeted at CXOs of public companies required for file financial statements to regulators


  + A concept visualization:
